Coin Collectors, history buffs welcome! Or perhaps you are just someone with curiosity of the ancient pa􀀵 coins and currency, and would love to learn some fascinating facts! As collectors, we pay homage to the history every time we add a coin to our collection. We believe that the history of an item is its most valuable asset. Along with the fascinating stories that come along with a coin's history is what gives it value and meaning and gives a collector a great way to connect with their collection in a much more real and meaningful way.

There are few things that provides such first hand insight into the lives and cultures of those from the ancient past than through the coins and currency used during that era. Like mini time capsules carrying images, they act as a snapshot forever capturing the ideas and beliefs of the cultures from which they came. These items that were right in the mix of things, exchanging hands by the-common man in everyday commerce, somehow managing to survive thousands of years until today, the writing and all, thereby providing us with firsthand insight into their culture, a direct connection to the past.

So, imagine learning that the plain, old coin is a Roman Denarius from 200BC, a common coin, but also the backbone of all Roman coinage forever inspiring all European coins from then on, or that your other coin is actually not a coin at all, but rather a bronze used the Early Roman Republic? How about discovering that the depiction the young man on another coin is actually of the supposedly young and beautiful Cleopatra, that it is amazingly 2000 years old from Nola, an infamous Ancient Rome mint city located on the other side of the planet, AND now sitting on the palm of your hand as the owner? One can see bow knowing a little bit of history can make something a bit more meaningful then it was without knowing it. But it seems as though coin shops did not prioritize or place any emphasis on that aspect of collecting if at all. Besides providing a short impromptu speech or a small synopsis on an items purchase page, you would usually leave with a coin and a receipt, throw it an album, and never learn any more of it.
